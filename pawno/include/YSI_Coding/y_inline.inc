					 y_inline - PAWN inline functions.
					===================================
Description:
	This library allows a user to write inline functions in their script.  It
	first detects all inline functions and generates data on them, such as
	parameter counts and addresses.  When an inline function is passed in code
	its current context data is stored.  Finally, when an inline function is
	found to be called at some point its current local stack is stored in global
	memory.  When the function actually is called, the stack is restored, and
	additional parameters which are the inline function parameters, are passed.
