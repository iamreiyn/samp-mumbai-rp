					 y_funcinc - Fix SYSREQ.C bugs
					===============================
Description:
	Calls functions which are used in SYSREQ.C calls before they are used.  The
	compiler crashes if the functions are not used in an included function
	before being used in a SYSREQ.C call as the function is not in the native
	functions table.
